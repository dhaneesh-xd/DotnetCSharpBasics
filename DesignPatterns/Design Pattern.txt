Creational Patterns:
Singleton:
	Only one instance is created for a class no matter how many times you called it.
Factory Method:
	A interface : class inherit that interface
	An abstract class with abstract method which returns that interface
	Another class inherit the abstract class.
Builder Method:
	Class having parameters
	interface created according to the paramters
	interface inherited to other class that uses the first class
	Another class created with method that getting the interface as input then implement interface parameter
Prototype Pattern:
	Interface created with clone prpoerty
	Class inherit that interface and clone method returns the class object
Adapter Pattern:
	Create an interface
	Implement class with required method
	create another class and inherit the interface, create object of above class in constructor (delegate)
