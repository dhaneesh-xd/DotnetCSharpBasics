Creational Patterns:
Singleton:
	Only one instance is created for a class no matter how many times you called it.
Factory Method:
	A interface : class inherit that interface : An abstract class with abstract method which returns that interface : Another class inherit the abstract class.
Builder Method:
	Class having parameters : interface created according to the paramters : interface inherited to other class that uses the first class : Another class created with method that getting the interface as input then implement interface parameter.
